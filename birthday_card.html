          This is a big one. Probably your biggest one. Today you are a third of
          the way through your entire life… And I'm so blessed to be able to
          spend it with you. Not just today, but life as a whole.
          <br />
          <br />
          As time goes on my love for you continues to grow. I see you growing
          and becoming an amazing woman. I see you settling into your role in
          our family and I just want you to know how proud of you I am. I can
          truly say I am proud to be your husband.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the years I’ve watched you step into the future you that you want
          to be, make really tough changes and sacrifice for us and our family.
          It hasn’t been overlooked. I see it and I appreciate you so much. As
          you grow another year older, my love for you deepens. It’s not like
          the love I used to have for you, it’s much different. It’s more solid
          and sure. I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I find
          it a great privilege to be able to live out the rest of my days as
          your husband.

          I know things are never perfect in our relationship. There are times
          that we get upset and angry at each other, times where we may say or
          do something hurtful to one another. But the one constant that will
          always be here is my love and my commitment to you and our marriage.
          Being faithful isn’t a feeling. It’s a choice and it’s not just about
          remaining committed inside our marriage. It’s about a mindset that
          knows there is no other route, no other doors, no plan B’s. When I
          said for better or for worse, I meant it. I hope you feel it’s been
          for the better. Although things aren’t perfect, I give thanks to God
          for bringing you into my life. I was a mess before I met you Katie. I
          had no direction and no reason to withhold anything from myself that
          was self destructive. It’s because of you that I want to change and
          let go of the old me and step into the new man and character that God
          has destined for me.
          <br />

          Maybe the ideal relationship isn’t achievable, maybe it’s not even a
          real thing, maybe it’s only in movies and we have this image of what
          we think is a perfect relationship. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t
          look around every now and then and remain in awe of what God has done
          in both of us and our life together. As a matter of fact, maybe our
          relationship is perfect or as close to it as it really can be. Maybe
          it’s all just perspective and gratitude for one another is the
          ingredient that connects it all together and creates the fulfillment
          we are both seeking. I have so much to be grateful for.
          <br />
          <br />
          As I get older, my desire to be a better husband to you grows. My
          desire to become a man that sacrifices grows as well. My commitment to
          you is unchanging and will remain unchanged even after our baby
          arrives, grows up and leaves to start their own family. I will be here
          for you. Because I love you Katie. With all my heart.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether boy or girl, Noel or Nora, Uriah or Grayson. We will all still
          have each other… And I will continue to grow in gratitude as all these
          blessings unfold and we grow old and spend our remaining days
          together. And truly… that’s all I could ever ask for.
